## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I'm getting familiar with CSS grid and a little bit of flexbox. I was also able to apply a color with opacity over the header image. 


### Continued development

Making responsive website is still hard for me. I made this based on the widths given, i.e. 375px and 1440px. I hope I can improve on this in the future.
